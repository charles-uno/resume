\ResumeSection{Summary}

Ten years automation and analysis in Python. Fluent in Linux and shell scripting. Recent emphasis on CI/CD/CT infrastructure with Jenkins, Docker, and REST APIs. Comfortable mentoring interns, onboarding employees, and creating educational materials for new technologies.

            \item Wrote a \textbf{Groovy} pipeline to build, test, and distribute RPMs in support of 100+ engineers.

            \item Illustrated pipeline usage with an annotated end-to-end example: a \textbf{REST API} written in \textbf{Go}, wrapped in a \textbf{Docker} container, and deployed to \textbf{Kubernetes} via \textbf{Ansible}.

            \item Rolled out a \textbf{Continuous Testing} solution for the Shasta product line. Secured VP buy-in, communicated requirements to dozens of product groups, and followed up on concerns.

            \item Designed a framework to execute nightly tests on live mainframes. Ingested results into an \textbf{ELK} database. Interfaced with \textbf{Slack} and \textbf{Jira} APIs to notify product owners of failures.

            \item Crawled the \textbf{Jenkins REST API} to monitor deployments of 6 product streams across 27 mainframes. Aggregated metrics onto a \textbf{CGI} dashboard viewed 100+ times daily.

            \item Implemented a \textbf{Python} API for access and analysis of mainframe system logs. Parsed terabytes of text to diagnose hardware failures on a \$70 million customer installation.

            \item Mentored two interns, both of whom were awarded extensions. Prepared and presented educational materials to onboard dozens of new employees.

%            \item Scraped and parsed mainframe logs to identify anomalous boot behavior in real time.

% CT stack: RPM build pipeline, teaching developers how to write/package tests, detecting and executing tests, sending results to ELK, notifying product owners of failures, aggregating health on a dashboard

% Cori has 12k+ nodes
% Crawled thousands of repos via BitBucket's REST API. Validated pipeline changes against live use cases to avoid disrupting product streams
% Triggered jobs via Jenkins REST API. Monitored the queue and throttled job submission to avoid deadlocking the build server
% Auto-detected tests at build time and registered them withTestRail via REST API
% Aggregated hardware and software status onto a CGI dashboard
% Mentored two interns, both of whom were awarded extensions.
% Prepared and presented educational materials to onboard dozens of new employees.
% Implemented a Python API for control and testing of the Cray XC cooling system. Isolated bugs that, if released, would have cost millions of dollars in waste and damage.
% Exported and analyzed mainframe logs for display in an ELK dashboard. Flagged anomalous boots in real time, allowing problems to be isolated in hours rather than days.
% Administered boots and upgrades for a 200-node Cray XC mainframe. Supported bizarre hardware and software configurations to maximize test coverage for a team of 20 engineers.
% Deployed a parallel \textbf{Python} harness to run nightly tests against Cray's performance analysis tools. Filed detailed bugs against Cray, Gnu, and Intel compilers.
% Automated shell environment configuration, \CPP and Fortran source code generation, and performance report parsing.
