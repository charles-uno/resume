## Software Engineer: DevOps and Testing @ Cray Inc, 2016--2021

- Led development of a monitoring framework for **Ansible**, **Kubernetes**, and hardware configuration on supercomputers. Published real-time updates to Slack via **REST API**, saving dozens of hours of manual triage daily.
- Wrote **CI/CD pipelines** to build, test, and deploy RPMs and **Docker**-based services on commit in support of 100+ engineers. Crawled thousands of **Git** repos via Jenkins and BitBucket APIs to validate pipeline updates against live use cases.
- Provisioned distributed resources via **Google Cloud** and **Terraform** for automated testing.
- Centralized access and analysis of supercomputer log files via multithreaded **Python**. Processed terabytes of text to diagnose hardware failures on a $70 million customer installation.

<!---
Interfaced with a **time series database** to aggregate build, test, and deployment documents. Extracted actionable metrics for developer, product owner, and VP use cases.

Vendors

- Built an ecosystem of **Python** and **Go** microservices for monitoring supercomputers. Detected failures in **Ansible**, **Kubernetes**, and hardware configuration. Cross-referenced build logs to identify product owners. Published real-time updates on Slack via **REST API**.
- Prioritized a **Scrum** backlog for a team of five engineers.

- Mentored a junior developers as they steered functionality into production.
- Created a **Groovy** pipeline to deploy **Docker**-based microservices on each **Git** commit. Enabled rapid iteration in a tightly-coupled ecosystem by aligning interfaces to industry best practices.

- Wrote a **CI/CD pipeline** to build, test, and distribute RPMs on commit in support of 100+ engineers.
- Crawled **Jenkins** via **REST API** to monitor the health of 6 products across 27 supercomputers. Aggregated metrics onto an **nginx**/**WSGI** dashboard accessed hundreds of times daily.
- Prototyped a pipeline to dynamically provision a virtual supercomputer-like resource on commit for automated testing. **Google Cloud**
- Refactored code to eliminate security risks. Wrote code that would work in an air-gapped system with no network access.
- Created a **Bash**/**Python** framework to automate testing on **Linux** supercomputers. Supported three development teams as they moved from quarterly release testing to continuous testing.
- Automated deployment of **Docker**-based services, including an **ELK** database and a **WSGI** dashboard. Enabled my team to iterate over dozens of commits per day in production-like environments.
- Mentored two interns, one of whom was hired full-time after graduation.
- Presented the Shasta test paradigm to an audience of 100+ engineers. Secured VP buy-in and followed up on concerns.
- Crawled thousands of repos via BitBucket's **REST API**. Validated pipeline changes against live use cases to avoid disrupting product streams
- Demonstrated pipeline best practices with an annotated end-to-end example: a **REST API** written in **Go**, wrapped in a **Docker** container, and deployed to **Kubernetes** via **Ansible**.
