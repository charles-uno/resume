        \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=\parindent]

            \item Illustrated pipeline best practices with an annotated end-to-end example: a \textbf{REST API} written in \textbf{Go}, wrapped in a \textbf{Docker} container, and deployed to \textbf{Kubernetes} via \textbf{Ansible}.



            \item Designed and rolled out \textbf{Continuous Testing} for the Shasta product line, including automatic deployment of tests to live mainframes.

            \item Continuous Testing rollout. Put requirements on 100 engineers. Fielded questions. Onboarded teams.
            \item Automatic detection and execution of tests on live mainframes.
            \item Publishing results to ELK. Live results to Slack via REST API. Automatic triage via JIRA API.


            \item Crawled thousands of repos via BitBucket's REST API. Validated pipeline updates against randomly-chosen use cases.

            \item Built a \textbf{Continuous Integration} pipeline with \textbf{Groovy}, \textbf{Docker}, and \textbf{shell} scripts. Automatically compiled, tested, and deployed \textbf{RPMs} in support of 100+ engineers.


            \item Implemented a \textbf{Python} API for access and analysis of mainframe system logs. Parsed terabytes of text to diagnose hardware failures on a \$70 million customer installation.

            \item Mentored two interns, both of whom were awarded extensions. Prepared and presented educational materials to onboard dozens of new employees.

            \item Automated interfaces with REST APIs for Jenkins, BitBucket, TestRail, and in-house applications.
            \item Scraped and parsed mainframe logs to identify anomalous boot behavior in real time.

            \item Audited pipeline health via Jenkins REST API. Aggregated live status for dozens of mainframes into a web dashboard.

            \item Designed and rolled out a cointinuous testing solution for Cray's next-generation line of multi-OS mainframes. Fielded questions from 100+ developers.





%            \item Deployed polished example repos for \textbf{\CPP}, \textbf{Go}, and \textbf{Python} to illustrate pipeline best practices. Fielded questions from 100+ developers about \textbf{Continuous Testing}.
%            \item Triggered \textbf{Jenkins} builds via \textbf{REST API}. Monitored the queue and throttled job submissions to run 50 multithreaded jobs without stalling a standalone build server.
% Jenkins REST API -- triggered job launch, load balance / throttling, cleanup
% Parsed out tests, assembled them into suites via the TestRail REST API
%            \item Interfaced with \textbf{REST APIs} for BitBucket and \textbf{Jenkins} using \textbf{Python} scripts. Automated triggers and cleanup to eliminate hours of error-prone browser menus.
% Cori has 12k+ nodes
%            \item Implemented a \textbf{Python} API for control and testing of the Cray XC cooling system. Isolated bugs that, if released, would have cost millions of dollars in waste and damage.
%            \item Exported and analyzed mainframe logs for display in an \textbf{ELK} dashboard. Flagged anomalous boots in real time, allowing problems to be isolated in hours rather than days.
%            \item Administered boots and upgrades for a 200-node Cray XC mainframe. Supported bizarre hardware and software configurations to maximize test coverage for a team of 20 engineers.
%            \item Deployed a parallel \textbf{Python} harness to run nightly tests against Cray's performance analysis tools. Filed detailed bugs against Cray, Gnu, and Intel compilers.
%            \item Automated \textbf{shell} environment configuration, \textbf{\CPP} and \textbf{Fortran} source code generation, and performance report parsing.
