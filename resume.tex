        \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=\parindent]

            \item Rolled out a \textbf{Continuous Testing} solution for the Shasta product line. Secured VP buy-in, communicated requirements to dozens of product groups, and followed up on concerns.

            \item Designed a \textbf{Bash}/\textbf{Python} framework to execute tests on live mainframes. Ingested results into an \textbf{ELK} database. Forwarded failures to product owners on Slack and JIRA via \textbf{REST API}.

            \item Wrote a \textbf{Groovy} pipeline to build, test, and distribute RPMs and Docker images in support of 100+ engineers. Illustrated pipeline best practices with annotated end-to-end examples.

            \item Crawled the \textbf{Jenkins REST API} to monitor deployments of 6 products across 27 mainframes. Aggregated metrics onto an \textbf{nginx}/\textbf{uWSGI} dashboard accessed 100+ times daily.

            \item Mentored three interns, two of whom were awarded extensions.

            \item Implemented a \textbf{Python} API for access and analysis of mainframe logs. Parsed terabytes of text to diagnose hardware failures on a \$70 million customer installation.

            \item Administered boots and upgrades for a 200-node Cray XC mainframe. Supported bizarre hardware and software configurations to maximize test coverage for a team of 20 engineers.

            \item Illustrated pipeline usage with an annotated end-to-end example: a \textbf{REST API} written in \textbf{Go}, wrapped in a \textbf{Docker} container, and deployed to \textbf{Kubernetes} via \textbf{Ansible}.

            \item Crawled thousands of automated builds via BitBucket and Jenkins \textbf{REST APIs}. Validated pipeline changes against live use cases to avoid disrupting product streams

            \item Built a CI/CD pipeline with \textbf{Groovy}, \textbf{Docker}, and \textbf{shell} scripts. Automatically compiled, tested, and deployed \textbf{RPMs} in support of 100+ engineers.

            \item Implemented a \textbf{Python} API for control and testing of the Cray XC cooling system. Isolated bugs that, if released, would have cost millions of dollars in waste and damage.

            \item Exported and analyzed mainframe logs for display in an \textbf{ELK} dashboard. Flagged anomalous boots in real time, allowing firmware bugs to be fixed in hours rather than days.

% Finagled with a 350GB "blob" on VMs. Terraform.

% both of whom were awarded extensions. Prepared and presented educational materials to onboard dozens of new employees.

% Scraped and parsed mainframe logs to identify anomalous boot behavior in real time.

% CT stack: RPM build pipeline, teaching developers how to write/package tests, detecting and executing tests, sending results to ELK, notifying product owners of failures, aggregating health on a dashboard

% Cori has 12k+ nodes
% Triggered jobs via Jenkins REST API. Monitored the queue and throttled job submission to avoid deadlocking the build server
% Auto-detected tests at build time and registered them with TestRail via REST API
% Aggregated hardware and software status onto a CGI dashboard
% Prepared and presented educational materials to onboard dozens of new employees.
% Deployed a parallel \textbf{Python} harness to run nightly tests against Cray's performance analysis tools. Filed detailed bugs against Cray, Gnu, and Intel compilers.
% Automated shell environment configuration, \CPP and Fortran source code generation, and performance report parsing.
% Mentored two interns, both of whom were awarded extensions. Prepared and presented educational materials to onboard dozens of new employees.
% Presented tech forum and fielded questions from 100+ coworkers.
% Automated interfaces with REST APIs for Jenkins, BitBucket, TestRail, and in-house applications.
% Scraped and parsed mainframe logs to identify anomalous boot behavior in real time.
% System status dashboard.
% Rolled out a continuous testing solution for Cray's next-generation line of multi-OS mainframes. Fielded questions from 100+ developers.
%  Deployed polished example repos for \textbf{\CPP}, \textbf{Go}, and \textbf{Python} to illustrate pipeline best practices. Fielded questions from 100+ developers about \textbf{Continuous Testing}.
% Triggered \textbf{Jenkins} builds via \textbf{REST API}. Monitored the queue and throttled job submissions to run 50 multithreaded jobs without stalling a standalone build server.
% Jenkins REST API -- triggered job launch, load balance / throttling, cleanup
% Parsed out tests, assembled them into suites via the TestRail REST API
% Interfaced with \textbf{REST APIs} for BitBucket and \textbf{Jenkins} using \textbf{Python} scripts. Automated triggers and cleanup to eliminate hours of error-prone browser menus.

% Deployed a parallel \textbf{Python} harness to run nightly tests against Cray's performance analysis tools. Filed detailed bugs against Cray, Gnu, and Intel compilers.

% Automated \textbf{shell} environment configuration, \textbf{\CPP} and \textbf{Fortran} source code generation, and performance report parsing.
