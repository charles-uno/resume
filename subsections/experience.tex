        \begin{itemize}
            \item Designed a magnetospheric wave simulation based primarily on academic literature. Studied magnetohydrodynamics and tensor analysis in order to master the underlying science. 
            \item Implemented \CPP and \Fortran benchmarks using \OpenMP and \MPI/\OpenMP. Improved performance by restructuring execution. 
            \item Analyzed hundreds of gigabytes of output to identify novel patterns. 
            \item Led peers with varying levels of experience as head teaching assistant. Developed exams, laboratory exercises, and other instructional materials.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Deployed an ensemble of serial, \MPI, and \MPI/\OpenMP synthetic tests in \C, \CPP, and \Fortran to assess Cray's performance tools suite. 
            \item Created a multi-process \Python harness to configure programming environments, dynamically generate source code, compile and run tests, and parse performance reports. 
            \item Isolated bugs in the performance tools, as well as in Cray, Gnu, and Intel compilers. 
            \item Brainstormed test features with other members of the performance tools team. Improved test usefulness and efficiency in response to feedback. 

%            \item Engaged with other members of the performance tools team to brainstorm additional synthetic test features. 
%            \item Discussed tests with other members of the Perftools team, solicited feedback, and refined the tests accordingly.
