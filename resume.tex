        \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=\parindent]
            \item Built a \textbf{CI/CD} pipeline using \textbf{Groovy}, \textbf{Docker}, and \textbf{shell} scripts. Automatically compiled, tested, and distributed \textbf{RPMs} on commit in support of 20 engineers.
            \item Triggered \textbf{Jenkins} builds via \textbf{REST API}. Monitored the queue and throttled job submissions to run 50 multithreaded jobs without stalling a standalone build server.
% Jenkins REST API -- triggered job launch, load balance / throttling, cleanup
% Parsed out tests, assembled them into suites via the TestRail REST API
%            \item Interfaced with \textbf{REST APIs} for BitBucket and \textbf{Jenkins} using \textbf{Python} scripts. Automated triggers and cleanup to eliminate hours of error-prone browser menus.
%            \item Prepared and presented annotated templates to spur unit testing.
            \item Implemented a \textbf{Python} API for access and analysis of mainframe system logs. Parsed terabytes of text to diagnose hardware failures on a \$70 million customer installation.
% Cori has 12k+ nodes
%            \item Implemented a \textbf{Python} API for control and testing of the Cray XC cooling system. Isolated bugs that, if released, would have cost millions of dollars in waste and damage.
%            \item Exported and analyzed mainframe logs for display in an \textbf{ELK} dashboard. Flagged anomalous boots in real time, allowing problems to be isolated in hours rather than days.
%            \item Administered boots and upgrades for a 200-node Cray XC mainframe. Supported bizarre hardware and software configurations to maximize test coverage for a team of 20 engineers.
            \item Mentored two interns, both of whom were awarded extensions. Prepared and presented educational materials to onboard dozens of new employees.

            \item Deployed a parallel \textbf{Python} harness to run nightly tests against Cray's performance analysis tools. Filed detailed bugs against Cray, Gnu, and Intel compilers.
            \item Automated \textbf{shell} environment configuration, \textbf{\CPP} and \textbf{Fortran} source code generation, and performance report parsing. Increased test code coverage dramatically.
%            \item Tailored test cases to the needs of the performance tools team. Responded promptly to feedback.
