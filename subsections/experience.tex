      \item Performed benchmarks in \CPP and \Fortran using \MPI and \OpenMP. Restructured execution to increase speed and decrease memory use. 
      \item Analyzed hundreds of gigabytes of output to identify novel patterns. Created clear, handsome plots and animations using \matplotlib. 
      \item Presented methods and results through posters, colloquia, and workshops. 
%\item Studied tensor analysis and magnetohydrodynamics to master the underlying concepts.

% Cray Performance Intern, 11/2014-present
% Deployed an ensemble of serial, MPI, and MPI/OpenMP synthetic tests in C, C++, and Fortran to assess Cray's performance tools suite. 
% Created a multi-process Python harness to configure programming environments, dynamically generate source code, compile and run tests, and perse performance reports. 
% Isolated bugs in the performance tools, as well as in Cray, Gnu, and Intel compilers. 
% Brainstormed test features with other members of the performance tools team. Improved test usefulness and efficiency in response to feedback. 

% UMN RA
% Designed a magnetospheric wave simulation basaed primarily on academic literature. Studied magnetohydrodynamics and tensor analysis in order to master the underlying science. 
% Implemented C++ and Fortran benchmarks using OpenMP and MPI/OpenMP. Improved performance by restructuring execution. 
% Analysed hundreds of gigabytes of output to identify novel patterns. 
% Presented methods and results through posters, colloquia, and workshops. 

% UMN TA
% Guided other graduate Teaching Assistants, as well as undergraduate Learning Assistants, as Head TA. 
% Developed exams, laboratory exercises, and other instructional materials. 
% Communicated detailed concepts to audiences with varied technical backgrounds. 
% Adapted coaching strategies to help at-risk students at an individual level. 

% Game Analyst
% Scraped, scrubbed, and stored ten years of play-by-play National Football League data.  Weighed "going for it" against kicking a field goal on fourth down. 
% Devised a hybrid analytical/computational solution to a novel problem in Magic: the Gathering. Published the results in a professional mathematics journal. 
% Leveraged combinatorics and monte carlo simulations to create fun, balanced house rules for Dungeons & Dragons, Fate Core, and other dice-based games. 

% Stolaf RA
% Coordinated with experts in multiple countries to construct and investigate mathematical topologies. 
% Led a computational search for emergent patterns in integer partition theory. 
% Produced polished manuscripts for publication. 

% Stolaf TA
% Tutored and chaperoned a group of 18 undergraduates through a four-week mathematics course in Budapest. 
% Exhibited professionalism while in a position of authority over friends. 

% Stolaf JC
% Served as a live-in counselor for a corridor of first-year undergraduates. Supported residents through interpersonal, academic, and bureaucratic challenges. 
% Divided time effectively between multiple obligations.
