# Experience

## FOOBAR @ Hewlett Packard Enterprise (2020-Present)

- Led development of a **Python**-based monitoring framework for HPE's Cray line of supercomputers. Detected failures automatically in **Ansible**, **Kubernetes**, and hardware configuration. Delivered real-time updates on Slack via **REST API**, saving dozens of person-hours of triage daily.
- Created a **CI/CD pipeline** to deploy **Docker**-based microservices on each **Git** commit. Enabled rapid iteration in a tightly-coupled ecosystem by aligning interfaces to industry best practices.
- Provisioned supercomputer-like resources via **Google Cloud** and **Terraform** for automated testing. Mentored a junior developer as they steered the functionality into production.
- Wrote a **Groovy** pipeline to build, test, and distribute RPMs in support of 100+ engineers.
- Aggregated build, test, and deployment data in a **time series database**. Extracted actionable metrics onto **nginx**/**WSGI** dashboards to satisfy developer, product owner, and VP use cases.

<!---
- Configured users and permissions via webhook
- Crawled **Jenkins** via **REST API** to monitor the health of 6 products across 27 supercomputers. Aggregated metrics onto an **nginx**/**WSGI** dashboard accessed hundreds of times daily.
- Prototyped a pipeline to dynamically provision a virtual supercomputer-like resource on commit for automated testing. **Google Cloud**
- Refactored code to eliminate security risks. Wrote code that would work in an air-gapped system with no network access.
- Created a **Bash**/**Python** framework to automate testing on **Linux** supercomputers. Supported three development teams as they moved from quarterly release testing to continuous testing.
- Automated deployment of **Docker**-based services, including an **ELK** database and a **WSGI** dashboard. Enabled my team to iterate over dozens of commits per day in production-like environments.
- Mentored two interns, one of whom was hired full-time after graduation.
- Presented the Shasta test paradigm to an audience of 100+ engineers. Secured VP buy-in and followed up on concerns.
- Crawled thousands of repos via BitBucket's **REST API**. Validated pipeline changes against live use cases to avoid disrupting product streams
- Demonstrated pipeline best practices with an annotated end-to-end example: a **REST API** written in **Go**, wrapped in a **Docker** container, and deployed to **Kubernetes** via **Ansible**.

## Visiting Assistant Professor @ St Olaf College (2020)

- Coached college juniors in advanced problem solving techniques, including modeling and data visualization in **Python**. Balanced lecture, group work, and one-on-one meetings to ensure each student's grasp of core concepts.
- Adapted smoothly to abrupt changes in COVID policy. Enlisted TAs to meet students' elevated need for support, re-prioritized curriculum to suit remote learning, and iterated over teaching tools.

<!---
 Delegated one-on-one support (in part) to two TAs to ensure each student's grasp of core concepts.
directed students to on-campus resources for health and support
Coordinated the efforts of a TA and two tutors to ensure each student's grasp of core concepts.
- unconventional/creative assignments, not just problems.
- Managed a TA and two tutors
- Balanced group work and one-on-one support to ensure mastery of each core concept.
- Pivoted unexpectedly from in-person to remote learning. Re-prioritized curriculum and iterated over teaching tools.

## Intern, System Test Engineer @ Cray Inc (2014-2019)

- Centralized access and analysis of supercomputer log files via a multithreaded **Python** package. Processed terabytes of text to diagnose hardware failures on a $70 million customer installation.
- Administered boots and upgrades on a 200-node **Linux** supercomputer in support of 20 engineers.
- Mentored two interns, both of whom were awarded extensions. Developed educational materials to onboard dozens of new employees.
- Automated scraping, parsing, and analysis of boot data from thousands of worker nodes. Identified performance regressions and correlated them with firmware updates.

<!---
- Launched **Jenkins** pipelines via webhook. Monitored the queue and throttled job submission to avoid deadlocking the skunkworks build server.
- Developed an object-oriented **Python** library for control and testing of the Cray XC liquid cooling system. Averted emergency reboots, thermal throttling, and tens of thousands of dollars in wasted power.
- we were doing Jenkins on a skunkworks server before anyone else at Cray!
Cori: 12k nodes, $70M
- Deployed an automated **Python** harness to run nightly tests against Cray's performance analysis tools. Filed detailed bugs against Cray, Gnu, and Intel compilers.

## Volunteer Coach @ Special Olympics Minnesota, 2018-Present

- Adapted coaching strategies to each athlete's physical abilities and communication skills.
- Coordinated warm-ups, meals, and parent concerns during full-day Area and State meets.
- Worked with 20 athletes aged 16 to 60 to improve health, strength, and confidence.
- incremental progress

<!---
## Shop Volunteer @ Science Museum of Minnesota, 2018-2020

- Developed microcontroller applications in **Python** and **C++** for use in museum exhibits.
- Soldering, exhibit assembly.
-->

<!---
## Research Assistant @ University of Minnesota, 2009-2016

- Benchmarked and optimized a model of near-Earth electromagnetic waves in parallel **Fortran**. Analyzed hundreds of gigabytes of data in **Python** to identify novel patterns.
- Tutored at-risk students individually, improving their performance by a full letter grade or more.
- Coordinated between professors, teaching assistants, and tutors as Head TA.
- Visualized data with **Matplotlib** to share via posters, papers, and workshops.
- Considered anomalous ring current activity as a novel driving mechanism
- automated job launch and data analysis in python
- Communicated detailed concepts to audiences with varied technical backgrounds.
- Coached new team members to improve student outcomes.
