    \item Administered boots and upgrades for a 200-node mainframe used by a team of 20 engineers.
%. Supported bizarre hardware and software configurations to maximize test coverage for a team of 20 engineers.
%    \item Implemented a Python API for control and testing of the Cray XC cooling system. Isolated bugs that, if released, would have cost millions of dollars in waste and damage.
    \item Deployed a parallel \textbf{Python} harness to run nightly tests against Cray's performance analysis tools. Filed detailed bugs against Cray, Gnu, and Intel compilers.
    \item Mentored three interns, two of whom were awarded extensions.
