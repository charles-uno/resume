    {Cray Inc}
    {\years{2014}{Present}}
\begin{myitemize}
    \item Created a \textbf{Bash}/\textbf{Python} framework to automate testing on \textbf{Linux} mainframes. Supported three development teams as they moved from quarterly release testing to continuous testing.
    \item Built an auto-triage system to forward test failures to product owners on Slack and/or Jira via \textbf{REST API}, saving dozens of person-hours of manual triage daily.
    \item Wrote a \textbf{CI} pipeline to deploy \textbf{Docker}-based services on commit, including an \textbf{ELK} database and a \textbf{WSGI} dashboard.




% dashboard. allowing VPs to show live data in meetings and presentations. business decisions

    \item Wrote a \textbf{Jenkins} pipeline to build, test, and distribute RPMs in support of 100+ engineers.




%    \item Administered boots and upgrades for a 200-node \textbf{Linux} mainframe in support of 20 engineers.
    \item Implemented a \textbf{Python} API for access and analysis of mainframe logs. Parsed terabytes of text to diagnose hardware failures on a \$70 million customer installation.
    \item Scraped boot data from thousands of nodes. Isolated firmware bugs in hours rather than days.




% Automatically provisioned a virtual mainframe on commit for testing.
% Crawled \textbf{Jenkins} via \textbf{REST API} to monitor the deployment of 6 products across 27 mainframes. Aggregated metrics onto an \textbf{nginx}/\textbf{WSGI} dashboard accessed 100+ times daily.
% ansible audit. is this meaningfully different from running tests?

% log access and analysis. diagnosed hardware failures on Cori, 12k nodes, $70M
% Implemented a Python API for control and testing of the Cray XC cooling system. Isolated bugs that, if released, would have cost millions of dollars in waste and damage.
% Crawled thousands of repos via BitBucket's REST API. Validated pipeline changes against live use cases to avoid disrupting product streams
% Triggered jobs via Jenkins REST API. Monitored the queue and throttled job submission to avoid deadlocking the build server
% Prepared and presented educational materials to onboard dozens of new employees.
% Deployed a parallel \textbf{Python} harness to run nightly tests against Cray's performance analysis tools. Filed detailed bugs against Cray, Gnu, and Intel compilers.
% Presented tech forum and fielded questions from 100+ coworkers.
% Automated interfaces with REST APIs for Jenkins, BitBucket, TestRail, and in-house applications.
% Rolled out a continuous testing solution for Cray's next-generation line of multi-OS mainframes. Fielded questions from 100+ developers.
% Triggered \textbf{Jenkins} builds via \textbf{REST API}. Monitored the queue and throttled job submissions to run 50 multithreaded jobs without stalling a standalone build server.
% Exported and analyzed mainframe logs for display in an \textbf{ELK} dashboard. Flagged anomalous boots in real time, allowing problems to be isolated in hours rather than days.
