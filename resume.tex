    {Cray Inc}
    {2014--Present}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Rolled out a \textbf{Continuous Testing} solution for the Shasta product line. Secured VP buy-in, communicated requirements to dozens of product groups, and followed up on concerns.
    \item Designed a \textbf{Bash}/\textbf{Python} framework to execute tests on live mainframes. Ingested results into an \textbf{ELK} database. Forwarded failures to product owners on Slack via \textbf{REST API}.
    \item Wrote a \textbf{Groovy} pipeline to build, test, and distribute RPMs and Docker images in support of 100+ engineers. Illustrated pipeline best practices with annotated end-to-end examples.
    \item Wrote a \textbf{Groovy} pipeline to build, test, and distribute RPMs in support of 100+ engineers.
    \item Crawled the \textbf{Jenkins REST API} to monitor deployments of 6 products across 27 mainframes. Aggregated metrics onto an \textbf{nginx}/\textbf{uWSGI} dashboard accessed 100+ times daily.
    \item Mentored three interns, two of whom were awarded extensions.
    \item Implemented a \textbf{Python} API for access and analysis of mainframe logs. Parsed terabytes of text to diagnose hardware failures on a \$70 million customer installation.


% Administered boots and upgrades for a 200-node Cray XC mainframe. Supported bizarre hardware and software configurations to maximize test coverage for a team of 20 engineers.


% Illustrated pipeline usage with an annotated end-to-end example: a \textbf{REST API} written in \textbf{Python}, wrapped in a \textbf{Docker} container, and deployed to \textbf{Kubernetes} via \textbf{Ansible}.

% Finagled with a 350GB "blob" on VMs. Terraform.

% both of whom were awarded extensions. Prepared and presented educational materials to onboard dozens of new employees.

% Scraped and parsed mainframe logs to identify anomalous boot behavior in real time.

% CT stack: RPM build pipeline, teaching developers how to write/package tests, detecting and executing tests, sending results to ELK, notifying product owners of failures, aggregating health on a dashboard

% Cori has 12k+ nodes
% Crawled thousands of repos via BitBucket's REST API. Validated pipeline changes against live use cases to avoid disrupting product streams
% Triggered jobs via Jenkins REST API. Monitored the queue and throttled job submission to avoid deadlocking the build server
% Auto-detected tests at build time and registered them withTestRail via REST API
% Aggregated hardware and software status onto a CGI dashboard
% Mentored two interns, both of whom were awarded extensions.
% Prepared and presented educational materials to onboard dozens of new employees.
% Implemented a Python API for control and testing of the Cray XC cooling system. Isolated bugs that, if released, would have cost millions of dollars in waste and damage.
% Exported and analyzed mainframe logs for display in an ELK dashboard. Flagged anomalous boots in real time, allowing problems to be isolated in hours rather than days.
% Deployed a parallel \textbf{Python} harness to run nightly tests against Cray's performance analysis tools. Filed detailed bugs against Cray, Gnu, and Intel compilers.
% Automated shell environment configuration, \CPP and Fortran source code generation, and performance report parsing.
% Built a \textbf{Continuous Integration} pipeline with \textbf{Groovy}, \textbf{Docker}, and \textbf{shell} scripts. Automatically compiled, tested, and deployed \textbf{RPMs} in support of 100+ engineers.
% Deployed polished examples in \textbf{\CPP}, \textbf{Go}, and \textbf{Python}.
% Implemented a \textbf{Python} API for access and analysis of mainframe system logs. Parsed terabytes of text to diagnose hardware failures on a \$70 million customer installation.
% Mentored two interns, both of whom were awarded extensions. Prepared and presented educational materials to onboard dozens of new employees.
% Presented tech forum and fielded questions from 100+ coworkers.
% Automated interfaces with REST APIs for Jenkins, BitBucket, TestRail, and in-house applications.
% Scraped and parsed mainframe logs to identify anomalous boot behavior in real time.
% System status dashboard.
% Rolled out a continuous testing solution for Cray's next-generation line of multi-OS mainframes. Fielded questions from 100+ developers.
%  Deployed polished example repos for \textbf{\CPP}, \textbf{Go}, and \textbf{Python} to illustrate pipeline best practices. Fielded questions from 100+ developers about \textbf{Continuous Testing}.
% Triggered \textbf{Jenkins} builds via \textbf{REST API}. Monitored the queue and throttled job submissions to run 50 multithreaded jobs without stalling a standalone build server.
% Jenkins REST API -- triggered job launch, load balance / throttling, cleanup
% Parsed out tests, assembled them into suites via the TestRail REST API
% Interfaced with \textbf{REST APIs} for BitBucket and \textbf{Jenkins} using \textbf{Python} scripts. Automated triggers and cleanup to eliminate hours of error-prone browser menus.
% Cori has 12k+ nodes
